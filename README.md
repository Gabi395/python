# Effects of Alcohol on Student Performance

## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between alcohol consumption and students’ academic performance. It aims to determine whether higher alcohol intake negatively impacts Yearly GPA and whether alcohol-related absenteeism contributes to lower academic outcomes.

## Project Description
The project analyzes a student dataset to explore how alcohol consumption and missed classes due to alcohol correlate with academic performance. The main goals are:
- To test hypotheses about the effect of alcohol on GPA.
- To examine gender differences in academic performance.
- To identify patterns between alcohol-related absenteeism and GPA.

## Methodology
- **Approach**:
    - Formulate hypotheses (null and alternative).
    - Clean and preprocess data (handling NaN values, converting text intervals to numeric midpoints).
    - Apply statistical analysis (correlation tests, visualization).

- **Tools/Technologies**:
    - Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).
    - Jupyter Notebook / Cursor editor for interactive analysis.

- **Data Sources**: Student dataset containing GPA, alcohol consumption, attendance records, and demographic information.


## Results
- Key finding 1: Gender differences in GPA are not significant, though females show slightly higher averages.
- Key finding 2: Alcohol consumption is negatively correlated with GPA — higher intake leads to lower performance.
- Key finding 3: Alcohol-related absenteeism is positively correlated with missed classes, which in turn lowers GPA.

## Conclusions
The analysis confirms that alcohol consumption has a measurable negative impact on academic performance. While gender differences are minor, the strongest effects are observed in the relationship between alcohol intake, absenteeism, and GPA. These findings highlight the importance of addressing alcohol-related behaviors to improve student outcomes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or Cursor IDE
